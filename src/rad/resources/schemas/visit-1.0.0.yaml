      executed_pattern:
        title: Executed Dither Pattern Offsets (arcsec)
        description: |
          The combination of the primary and subpixel
          dither patterns (if selected) in units of arcseconds. If
          a subpixel dither pattern is selected, then all of the
          subpixel dither offsets are performed at each of the
          points in the primary dither pattern. Thus, the total
          number of dither offsets executed is the product of the
          number of points in the primary and subpixel dither
          patterns. The array contains (X, Y) pairs of offsets in
          the subpixel dither pattern where the X and Y
          coordinates are defined in the ideal system. The ideal
          coordinate system is a geomtric-distortion-corrected
          reference frame projected onto a tangent plane. For more
          information, see the Science Instrument Aperture File
          (SIAF) and associated documentation. The exposure
          identifier in meta.observation.exposure can be used to
          index this array to obtain the relative pointing offset
          from the initial target position for this exposure. Note
          that the exposure identifier is 1-indexed.

  engineering_quality:
    title: Engineering Data Quality
    description: |
      Indicator of data quality problems with the
      engineering data used to populated select metadata fields. A
      value of "OK" indicates no suspected problems, while a value of
      "SUSPECT" indicates one or more metadata values populated from
      the engineering database may be missing information during the
      exposure or are otherwise of lower quality.

  pointing_engineering_source:
    title: Pointing Engineering Source
    description: |
      The source type of the pointing information in the
      metadata may be set to either "PLANNED" or "CALCULATED". If the
      value is "PLANNED", then pointing mnemonics were not found in
      the engineering database, and the pointing data were taken from
      the observation planning information. If the value is
      "CALCULATED", then the pointing data were determined using the
      information in the engineering database.
