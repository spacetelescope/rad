  flux:
    title: Flux Scale Application Step
    description: |
      Step in ROMANCAL which applies the scaling factors determined in the Photom calibrations step.
      The data are converted from DN/s to MJy/sr.
    type: string

      destination: [ScienceRefData.s_flux]
  outlier_detection:
    title: Outlier Detection Step
    description: |
      Step in ROMANCAL which detects and flags outliers in a science image.
    type: string
    enum: ['N/A', 'COMPLETE', 'SKIPPED', 'INCOMPLETE']
    maxLength: 15
    archive_catalog:
      datatype: nvarchar(15)

  skymatch:
    title: Sky Matching for Combining Overlapping Images Step
    description: |
      Step in ROMANCAL that computes sky background values of each input image
      and derives scalings to equalize overlapping regions.
    type: string
    enum: ['N/A', 'COMPLETE', 'SKIPPED', 'INCOMPLETE']
    maxLength: 15
    archive_catalog:
      datatype: nvarchar(15)

  resample:
    title: Resampling Input Data onto a Regular Grid Step
    description: |
      Step in ROMANCAL which resamples each input 2D image based on its WCS and
      WCS distortion information on a grid that allows the combination of
      multiple resampled images into a single, undistorted product.
