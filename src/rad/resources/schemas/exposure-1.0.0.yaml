    title: Multi-Accumulation Table Identification Number
    description: |
      A unique identification number for the

  read_pattern:
    title: Read Pattern
    description: |
      The enumeration of detector reads to resultants making
      up the Level 1 ramp data cube. The read pattern is nested such
      that each grouping of read numbers represents a resultant. For
      example, a readout pattern of [[1], [2, 3], [4]] consists of
      four reads that were downlinked as three resultants with both
      the first and last resultant each containing a single read.
