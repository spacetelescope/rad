    title: Programmatic Observation Identifier
    description: |
      The format of the programmatic observation identifier is
      'PPPPPCCAAASSSOOOVVVggsaaeeee' where 'PPPPP' is the program, 'CC' is the
      execution plan, 'AAA' is the pass, 'SSS' is the segment number, 'OOO' is
      the observation, 'VVV' is the visit, 'gg' is the visit file group, 's' is
      the visit file sequence, 'aa' is the visit file activity, and 'eeee' is
      the exposure ID. The observation ID is the complete concatenation of
      visit_id + visit_file_statement (visit_file_group + visit_file_sequence +
      visit_file_activity) + exposure.
