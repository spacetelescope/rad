  obs_id:
    title: Programmatic observation identifier. The format is 'PPPPPCCAAASSSOOOVVVggsaaeeee' where
           'PPPPP' is the Program, 'CC' is the execution plan, 'AAA' is the pass, 'SSS' is the
           segment, 'OOO' is the Observation, 'VVV' is the Visit, 'gg' is the visit file group,
           's' is the visit file sequence, 'aa' is the visit file activity, and 'eeee' is the
           exposure ID. The observation ID is the complete concatenation of visit_id +
           visit_file_statement (visit_file_group + visit_file_sequence + visit_file_activity) +
           exposure.
