    title: Aperture Position Angle (deg)
    description: |
      Position angle in degrees of the aperture ideal Y axis
      relative to the V3 axis of the spacecraft. This information
      comes from the Science Instrument Aperture File (SIAF) in the
      Science Operations Center (SOC) Project Reference Database
      (PRD).

    title: Pointing Engineering Source
    description: |
      The source type of the pointing information in the
      metadata may be set to either "PLANNED" or "CALCULATED". If the
      value is "PLANNED", then pointing mnemonics were not found in
      the engineering database, and the pointing data were taken from
      the observation planning information. If the value is
      "CALCULATED", then the pointing data were determined using the
      information in the engineering database.

  ra_v1:
    title: Right Ascension of the Telescope V1 Axis (deg)
    description: |
      The right ascension coordinate of the V1 axis in units
      of degrees. This may be considered the right ascension
      coordinate of the telescope boresight. The telescope V
      coordinate system is defined with its origin at the vertex of
      the primary mirror. The V1 axis is orthogonal to the primary
      mirror, parallel to the telescope boresight, and increasing
      positively through the telescope aperture. See
      Roman-STScI-000143 "Description of the Roman SIAF and Coordinate
      Frames" for more information.

    title: Declination of the Telescope V1 Axis (deg)
    description: |
      The declination coordinate of the V1 axis in units of
      degrees. This may be considered the declination coordinate of
      the telescope boresight. The telescope V coordinate system is
      defined with its origin at the vertex of the primary mirror. The
      +V1 axis is orthogonal to the primary mirror, parallel to the
      telescope boresight, and increasing positively through the
      telescope aperture. See Roman-STScI-000143 "Description of the
      Roman SIAF and Coordinate Frames" for more information.

  pa_v3:
    title: Position Angle of the Telescope V3 Axis (deg)
    description: |
      The position angle of the V3 axis (in units of
      degrees) is defined as the projection of the V3 axis on the sky
      measured from North to East. The telescope V coordinate system
      is defined with its origin at the vertex of the primary mirror.
      The +V3 axis is defined to be orthogonal to the sunshield. See
      Roman-STScI-000143 "Description of the Roman SIAF and Coordinate
      Frames" for more information.
