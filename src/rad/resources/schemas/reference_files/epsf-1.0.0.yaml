    title: ePSF Stamps
    description: Postage stamps of ePSF models. The 5-dimensional array is
        ordered by (defocus, spectral_type, grid_index, y, x), where defocus
        and spectral_type are in the file metadata, grid_index is the index
        of the pixel_x and pixel_y positions in the file metadata, and
        y and x are the axes of the 2-D postage stamp ePSF.
