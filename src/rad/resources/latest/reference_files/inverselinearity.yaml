    title: Inverse Linearity Coefficients
    description: |
      Contains the coefficients of a polynomial which describe the non-linear
      response of each pixel to a linear signal. Both the input to and output
      from the polynomial are in units of DN. The coefficients have units that
      contain various powers of DN.
