      A boolean flag to indicate if the Relative Calibration
      System (RCS) is on (True) or off (False) during the exposure.

    title: Relative Calibration System (RCS) Electronics Side
    description: |
      The active redundant electronics used to control the
      Relative Calibration System (RCS). Values may be "A" or "B" if
      the RCS is on, and "N/A" if the RCS is off.

    title: Light Emitting Diode (LED) Bank Selection
    description: |
      The bank of light emitting diodes (LEDs) selected in
      the program specification in the Astronomer's Proposal Tool
      (APT). Values may be either "1" or "2" if the RCS is on, and
      "N/A" if the RCS is off.

    description: |
      The light emitting diode (LED) passband selected in
      the program specification in the Astronomer's Proposal Tool
      (APT). Values are integer strings between "1" and "6" inclusive,
      when the RCS is on, and "N/A" when the RCS is off.

    description: |
      The integrated number of counts of the light emitting
      diode (LED) selected in the program specification in the
      Astronomer's Proposal Tool (APT). Values are between 0 and
      65,535 in units of DN.
