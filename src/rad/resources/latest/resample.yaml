title: Resample Information
type: object
properties:
  good_bits:
    title: Bit Mask
    description: |
      Bit mask used in resample.
    type: string
  pixel_scale_ratio:
    title: Pixel Scale Ratio
    description: |
      The pixel scale ratio compared to the input scale that resample will use
      during processing. For example, a pixel scale ratio of 0.9 will produce a
      resampled resultant image with smaller pixels than the native pixel scale
      of the detector.
    type: number
  pixfrac:
    title: Pixel Fraction
    description: |
      The fraction of a pixel to use for pixel convolution.
    type: number
  pointings:
    title: Number of Pointings
    description: |
      The number of pointings combined with the resample processing.
    type: integer
  product_exposure_time:
    title: Product Exposure Time
    description: |
      The total exposure time for the resampled product.
    type: number
  members:
    title: Resample Members
    description: |
      Filenames of resample members
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  weight_type:
    title: Weight Type
    description: |
      The weight type used by the drizzle algorithm in the resample processing.
      The two weight options available are exposure time ("exptime") and inverse
      variance map ("ivm").
    type: string
    enum: ["exptime", "ivm"]
propertyOrder: [good_bits, members, pixel_scale_ratio, pixfrac, pointings, product_exposure_time, weight_type]
