title: Footprint Information
extName: SSC

# For cone searches to work (one of the most popular search criteria) a footprint must be defined. It is best if this is sent along from SSC in the manifest, rather than attempted to be computed by MAST.
# This is a polygon represented as a string, max length should be adjusted based on actual values and needs.
# Example: POLYGON ICRS 270.319355102 65.974344371 270.322525221 66.097218677 270.012545446 66.097236236 270.012492360 65.974274943
