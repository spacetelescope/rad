title: Basic keywords across all SSC file types

# Note: These keywords are automatically added to the ingest manifest
# by the SOC's SSC file receipt lambda.  SSC does NOT need to include
# these in the 'metadata' object of the data availability notification.
# These are a subset of the RAD basic keywords (https://github.com/spacetelescope/rad/blob/main/latest/basic.yaml)
