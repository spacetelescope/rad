title: CCSP custom product metadata
description: |
  This schema is the union of all shared metadata for Roman Community
  Contributed Science Product (CCSP) data. It should be referenced in
  the schemas of custom data products which do not closely mimic the
  metadata of Roman SOC mission products. Otherwise, for data products
  whose schemas reference or closely mimic SOC schemas, reference the
  ccsp_minimal schema directly instead.
