title: CCSP minimal metadata
description: |
  This schema defines metadata for Roman Community Contributed Science
  Product (CCSP) data. It should be referenced directly in the schemas
  of data products that are reprocessed versions of Roman SOC mission
  products, and which already include required metadata defined in
  existing SOC schemas. Otherwise, for CCSP products which do not so
  closely mimic SOC products, use the ccsp_custom_product schema instead.
