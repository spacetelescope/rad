title: Resample Parameters
type: object
properties:
  good_bits:
    title: Bit Mask
    description: >
      Bit mask used in the resample step. This key contains
      strings that correspond to bits in the data quality (DQ) arrays
      of calibrated rate images. Bits are combined using plus signs
      (+) and use the bitwise operator tilde (~) to denote exclusion.
      For example, the string "~DO_NOT_USE+NON_SCIENCE" means to allow
      all data quality bits except DO_NOT_USE and NON_SCIENCE to be
      included in the final product. Conversely, a string of "GOOD"
      would only allow pixels with DQ bits equal to 0 in the
      calibrated rate images to be included in the final product.
    type: string
  pixel_scale_ratio:
    title: Pixel Scale Ratio
    description: >
      The ratio of the pixel scale compared to the native
      detector pixel scale. For example, a pixel scale of 0.9 will
      produce a resampled image with smaller pixels compared to the
      input calibrated rate images.
    type: number
  pixfrac:
    title: Pixel Fraction
    description: The fraction of a pixel to use for pixel convolution.
    type: number
  pointings:
    title: Number of Input Images
    description: >
      The number of input images combined with resample into an output product.
    type: integer
  members:
    title: Resample Input Filenames
    description: >
      Names of the calibrated rate image files input into
      the resample code to create the output product.
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
  weight_type:
    title: Weight Type
    description: >
      The weight type used by the drizzle algorithm in the
      resample step. The two weight options available are exposure
      time ("exptime") and inverse variance map ("ivm") weighting.
    type: string
required:
  [good_bits, members, pixel_scale_ratio, pixfrac, pointings, weight_type]
