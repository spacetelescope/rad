Refactor the ``individual_image_meta`` tables schema to be its own metadata schema, and
updating the contents of the schema so that it provides purely informational links to the
schemas defining the tables within the ``individual_image_meta`` schema. This is to help
document the contents of those tables, without us having to explicitly define the table
columns which would necessitate partial duplications of the schemas that are now linked
to in the table with minor changes to enable compatibility with how tables function.
